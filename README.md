# LSE-61: LSST Data Management System Requirements

Baselined versions of this document can be obtained from DocuShare at <https://ls.st/LSE-61>.

This repository hosts reports from the LSE-61 MagicDraw model in LaTeX format.

To generate a new version of the document from the model follow the instructions in the Latex section of the [MagicDraw-macros](https://github.com/lsst-se/MagicDraw-macros) repository (in `docgen_templates/latex`).

Check that it builds before committing the generated LSE-61.
The document requires the [lsst-texmf](https://lsst-texmf.lsst.io) LaTeX classes are available.

The document title, author, date, document handle, and change record are defined in the file `metadata.tex`.
This allows you to specify these outside of the generic MagicDraw template file.
